- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Vivid-Pixel. In a sea of GitHub repos, you found me!
- ðŸ‘€ I have an appreciation for vintage technology. Sometimes newer isn't better, but it can be.
- ðŸŒ± Currently creating things with [B4X](https://www.b4x.com) and [AGK Studio](https://www.appgamekit.com/studio). (See also: [Cerberus X](https://www.cerberus-x.com/community/index.php))
