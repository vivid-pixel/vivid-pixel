- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Vivid-Pixel. In a sea of GitHub repos, you found me!
- ðŸ‘€ I'm always interested in learning about vintage or lesser-known technology. Newer isn't always better, and sometimes I prefer something different rather than what's popular amongst others. If I'm making something that's been made a billion times before, why not try another approach?
- ðŸŒ± Tinkering with modern BASIC dialects is a joy. Some favorites: [B4X](https://www.b4x.com), [PureBasic](https://purebasic.com)/[SpiderBasic](https://spiderbasic.com), [QB64PE](https://qb64phoenix.com)
