- 👋 Hi, I’m @vivid-pixel.
- 👀 I have an appreciation for older technology, yet my home wouldn't be complete without some automated smart devices and my virtual reality room!
- 🌱 Currently learning PureBasic for fun, and studying Algebra on a path to learn Calculus.
- 📫 You can send me some electronic mail: admin at vividpixel dot co.
- I had some substantial Java projects here that were created while earning my degree, but I was asked by a faculty member to make the repositories private.
